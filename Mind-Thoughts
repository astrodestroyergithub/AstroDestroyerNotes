I welcome myself to the very popular GitHub community!!!

Here I will try to bring a new feel in my coding life
At first...

I'll manage all my codes here as a online ref...

So far, I forgot to mention that I had already stored the C++/Java/Python codes for Four-Square-Cipher...

Now after short break I pushed the Java code for the new Polybius-Square-Cipher :)
