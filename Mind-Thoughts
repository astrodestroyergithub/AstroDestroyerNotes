I welcome myself to the very popular GitHub community!!!

Here I will try to bring a new feel in my coding life
At first...

I'll manage all my codes here as a online ref...

So far, I forgot to mention that I had already stored the C++/Java/Python codes for Four-Square-Cipher...

Now after short break I pushed the Java code for the new Polybius-Square-Cipher :)

Time has passed so fast that I myself am not able to recall what are all the codes, I wrote with context to cryptography. Maybe, this I should leave (keeping track of all the codes for the encryption, decryption, etc. for each and every cryptographic cipher).
Because, where will it ultimately take me, right? Yeah, but occassional attempts are welcome. No harm to that, right...

Transaction Management System is aroung the corner ig :")
...as it says "Let us address the common problems of splitting of money between teenagers to avoid the common day-to-day confusions hovering over the minds of fellow teenagers of problems pertaining to borrowing and lending of capital in everyday gatherings, get-togethers, or even urgency cases of money requirement. Problems regarding finance are one of the modern demands which needs to be replenished with innovative solutions. Although many high-end tech are out there to tackle the difficulties of the same, we are still bereft of the solutions to manage the simple ones only to even provide effective solutions to a mere group of college going students! Through this approach we aim to provide a strong foundational answer to it.

Hey guys, I recently added "Game Planet" in my GitHub account (although I had created it long back, nearly 6 months ago -_-)
So yeah, I has been a long time since I pushed any such project in my GitHub account. Hope that you all will not mind!
At last, I can say with confidence that days of Transaction Management System are gone, and the days of Gaming and game review systems are around the corner!!!
